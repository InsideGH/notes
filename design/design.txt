  Lato/Helvetica - transitional sans-serif
  New Times Roman - transitional serif

  "Sorts Mill Goudy"/Palatino - Humanist serif
  Cabin - Humanist sans-serif






* Sizing
  Large elements draw attention and then to smaller elements to help digest content.
  
  Sea of text, avoid.
    Take first row/sentece and make headline, allows user to latch onto.

  Howto
    1) Start with body copy (16 px)
    2) HeadLine (200-300% of body copy)
    3) B-Head (150%)
    4) Nav (100%)
    5) Bi-line (2-4 px smaller, 75%)

* Leading
  Amount of space between lines (base to base).
  Good leading is 120%-150% of body copy size.
  css.line-height: 1.5

* Bold/italics (less is more).

* Line width
  Measured in cpl (characters per line) 50-70 / line is ideal (inc spaces)

  widow  - single word in line
  orphan - single line on page


** Color
  Two types : can touch (substractive color) and can't touch (additive color).

  substractive color
    controlled using cmyk space. All colors mixed -> black.

  additive color
    controlled using rgb space. All colors mixed -> white.

  humans process colors
    hsl (Hue Saturation lightness)
    Hue
      Best visualized on color wheel. Start at 0 (red), 120 (green), 240 (blue)
    Saturation
      Difference between color and grey. (0% gray 100% vibrant)
    Lightness
      Amount of light in a color (0% black, 50% most vibrant, 100% white)

    (Photoshop etc might not use lightness but instead brightness) Brightness
    goes from (0) black to (100) vibrant and does not reach white.
    


  Color scheme (4-5 colors)
    Button, text, backgrounds.
    1) Choose base color, different colors create different moods.
       Red - heat, passion, excitment, grabs attention. energy.
       Orange - warmth and vitality. Reliability and playfulness.
       Yellow - Optimism, creativity. Sunshine and cheer happines.
       Green - Serenity, health. Growth, nature and freshness.

       Brown - Durability, class. Age, stability, relaxation.
       Black - Power, drama. Serious bold and strong.
       White - Simplicity, cleanliness. 

    2) Build upon base color
       2.1 Monochromatic (same hue - vary in saturation and lightness)
       2.2 Analogous (desc and asc hue - vary in saturation and lightness)
           max 60 deg on either side difference (30deg per step with 2 steps)
       2.3 Complementary (opposite hue - vary in saturation and lightness)
           Same hue on left, opposite on right side.


Color and Type
  Important to have high contrast (difference in color).
  WCAG2 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
    
   Black- white are best
   Same hue, high sat and light contrast - second best.
  
   Difficult: red+green and blue+orange
   
   colors are naturally values
     yellow light.
     blue darker.
   mixing these with opposite values (dark yellow + light blue) is not good.


   warm and cold colors, not to be used as contract but DEPTH.
     warm (red orange yellow)
     cold (green blue purple)

   warm closer to user than blue. Use cool colors in bg and warm in foreground.


  Skip drop shadows...
