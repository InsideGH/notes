User Centered Design (UCD)
Step 1, identify primary feature
Step 2, understand why personas need the feature
Step 3, research how others solved it
Step 4, sketch/wireframe
Step 5, design

Step 1
  Where the match is best in all personas -> primary feature

  Question? Is this matching the initial "Required info"?

  If yes, found primary feature.

Step 2

Step 3
  Large search field,
  Keywords associated with my current seach (engagement)
  Filter search
  Search result in cards

Step 4
  a) Sketch on paper
  b) wireframe (omnigraffle, Sketch, Balsamiq) - test on users
     Always with real content (not ipsum)
  c) test multiple wireframes on users (5-7 users)
     5 second test (impressions)
     1) What does this feature do?
     2) What do you like about it?
     3) What don't you like about it?

Information architecture
  Label and organize content to make it easier to find.
  road signs, subway maps etc
  Helps users to know where they are and where to go.

  The four ways of searching
  1) we know what we want
  2) Explortory (know it, but not where)
  3) Unknown - don't know what we search for, and where
  4) Re-finding

  1) Search, index, quicklinks
  2) Search, navigation
  3) simple language, personal communication
  4) history

  A)
    Put all pages on cards
    Sort in piles (using real users)
    Then sort piles of significance (top is navigation name)

  B)
    Build site map
        Homepage
    |              |
    Articles      About

  C)
    Persistent navigation, search and logo to get back to homepage.
    Maybe a utility navigation (smaller, max 3-4 items)

  D)
    Secondary navigation goes into each primary page on the
    left side.

  E)
    Make it easier to know where you are with active states.
    Always show the page title on the page.

Mobile
  Responsive to any device
  Mobile app should be consistent with app (user will know how to use the product)
  Even if the structure is different and looks difference between devices, the content
  should be continuous. That is, for example if article is read on mobile, it should
  be on read items on webapp.

  Design for the context, not the device!
