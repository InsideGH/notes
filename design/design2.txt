Personas
  Required info
    What to be able to do on a website

  Where to start?
    Educated assumptions
    Focus group
    Interview current users

    or ->
      If new product - create -----assumption persona------.
        1) Pull quote and image - "i only have a minute"
        2) Name, title, Marital status (understand lifestyle)
        3) Goals
        4) Concerns - "save articles for later, read on ipad etc"

    other
      2-4 personas per project
      creates a shared understanding of who the user is
      help you empathize with the user.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User Centered Design (UCD)
Step 1, identify primary feature
Step 2, understand why personas need the feature
Step 3, research how others solved it
Step 4, sketch/wireframe
Step 5, design

Step 1
  Where the match is best in all personas -> primary feature

  Question? Is this matching the initial "Required info"?

  If yes, found primary feature.

Step 2

Step 3
  Large search field,
  Keywords associated with my current search (engagement)
  Filter search
  Search result in cards

Step 4
  a) Sketch on paper
  b) wireframe (omnigraffle, Sketch, Balsamiq) - test on users
     Always with real content (not ipsum)
  c) test multiple wireframes on users (5-7 users)
     5 second test (impressions)
     1) What does this feature do?
     2) What do you like about it?
     3) What don't you like about it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Information architecture
  Label and organize content to make it easier to find.
  road signs, subway maps etc
  Helps users to know where they are and where to go.

  The four ways of searching
  1) we know what we want
  2) Exploratory (know it, but not where)
  3) Unknown - don't know what we search for, and where
  4) Re-finding

  1) Search, index, quicklinks
  2) Search, navigation
  3) simple language, personal communication
  4) history

  A)
    Put all pages on cards
    Sort in piles (using real users)
    Then sort piles of significance (top is navigation name)

  B)
    Build site map
        Homepage
    |              |
    Articles      About

  C)
    Persistent navigation, search and logo to get back to homepage.
    Maybe a utility navigation (smaller, max 3-4 items)

  D)
    Secondary navigation goes into each primary page on the
    left side.

  E)
    Make it easier to know where you are with active states.
    Always show the page title on the page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Navigation
  With the primary navigation in place.

  Descriptor navigation
    For example separate content into topics (smashingmagazine, spotify (mood, party, etc))

  Dashboard navigation, verb based (action!). Usually on financial sites (invest, trading, etc)

  User based navigation. Common on pricing pages (litmus page)

  50%/50% between search and persistent navigation.

  Google page view percentage. More than half don't scroll. Only 42% sees 2nd page.

  Sorting
    To provide more search result to user, use sorting (recent, popular, most commented)
    Does not remove anything, just sorted.

  Filter
    Removes irrelevant.

  Tagging, possibility for users to set tags.

  Meta tagging, common on commercial sites. Filter on color, brand, etc.

  Pagination when having large results.

  Tabs

  Summary
    Top navigation helps to find stuff
    Descriptor navigation helps with page discovery

  Top/Down
    Navigation
    Tagline
    Welcome message
    Call to action

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Form
  Start by sketching what we need in the form
  Do not create a zigzag form (eye moving right to left)
    Move the labels on top of input
  Remove unnecessary fields
  Making required fields, makes user skip optional.
  Making fields optional, is better.
  Error handling should be clear and never blame user.
  Research shows that default choice is kept. Decision is made for them. Called
  explicit choice.
  Make buttons large, so that younger and older can hit them easier.
  Use clear button text.
  Always use the hand cursor when hover over link.

  Confirmation message, only use when user is doing something irreversible. Or
  something that is hard to understand if accidentally done (skype mute ex)

  Upon submission, congratulate them. This is a mini-win.

  Accessibility
    Never put text in images (screen readers can't read it)
    Avoid low contrast.
    Keep logical order of fields.
    Test with Wave (wave.webaim.org)
    Test with chrome color contrast
