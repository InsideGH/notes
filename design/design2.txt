Personas
  Required info
    What to be able to do on a website

  Where to start?
    Educated assumptions
    Focus group
    Interview current users

    or ->
      If new product - create -----assumption persona------.
        1) Pull quote and image - "i only have a minute"
        2) Name, title, Marital status (understand lifestyle)
        3) Goals
        4) Concerns - "save articles for later, read on ipad etc"

    other
      2-4 personas per project
      creates a shared understanding of who the user is
      help you empathize with the user.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User Centered Design (UCD)
  Step 1, identify primary feature
  Step 2, understand why personas need the feature
  Step 3, research how others solved it
  Step 4, sketch/wireframe
  Step 5, design

  Step 1
    Where the match is best in all personas -> primary feature

    Question? Is this matching the initial "Required info"?

    If yes, found primary feature.

  Step 2

  Step 3
    Large search field,
    Keywords associated with my current search (engagement)
    Filter search
    Search result in cards

  Step 4
    a) Sketch on paper
    b) wireframe (omnigraffle, Sketch, Balsamiq) - test on users
       Always with real content (not ipsum)
    c) test multiple wireframes on users (5-7 users)
       5 second test (impressions)
       1) What does this feature do?
       2) What do you like about it?
       3) What don't you like about it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Information architecture
  Label and organize content to make it easier to find.
  road signs, subway maps etc
  Helps users to know where they are and where to go.

  The four ways of searching
  1) we know what we want
  2) Exploratory (know it, but not where)
  3) Unknown - don't know what we search for, and where
  4) Re-finding

  1) Search, index, quicklinks
  2) Search, navigation
  3) simple language, personal communication
  4) history

  A)
    Put all pages on cards
    Sort in piles (using real users)
    Then sort piles of significance (top is navigation name)

  B)
    Build site map
        Homepage
    |              |
    Articles      About

  C)
    Persistent navigation, search and logo to get back to homepage.
    Maybe a utility navigation (smaller, max 3-4 items)

  D)
    Secondary navigation goes into each primary page on the
    left side.

  E)
    Make it easier to know where you are with active states.
    Always show the page title on the page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Navigation
  With the primary navigation in place.

  Descriptor navigation
    For example separate content into topics (smashingmagazine, spotify (mood, party, etc))

  Dashboard navigation, verb based (action!). Usually on financial sites (invest, trading, etc)

  User based navigation. Common on pricing pages (litmus page)

  50%/50% between search and persistent navigation.

  Google page view percentage. More than half don't scroll. Only 42% sees 2nd page.

  Sorting
    To provide more search result to user, use sorting (recent, popular, most commented)
    Does not remove anything, just sorted.

  Filter
    Removes irrelevant.

  Tagging, possibility for users to set tags.

  Meta tagging, common on commercial sites. Filter on color, brand, etc.

  Pagination when having large results.

  Tabs

  Summary
    Top navigation helps to find stuff
    Descriptor navigation helps with page discovery

  Top/Down
    Navigation
    Tagline
    Welcome message
    Call to action

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Form
  Start by sketching what we need in the form
  Do not create a zigzag form (eye moving right to left)
    Move the labels on top of input
  Remove unnecessary fields
  Making required fields, makes user skip optional.
  Making fields optional, is better.
  Error handling should be clear and never blame user.
  Research shows that default choice is kept. Decision is made for them. Called
  explicit choice.
  Make buttons large, so that younger and older can hit them easier.
  Use clear button text.
  Always use the hand cursor when hover over link.

  Confirmation message, only use when user is doing something irreversible. Or
  something that is hard to understand if accidentally done (skype mute ex)

  Upon submission, congratulate them. This is a mini-win.

  Accessibility
    Never put text in images (screen readers can't read it)
    Avoid low contrast.
    Keep logical order of fields.
    Test with Wave (wave.webaim.org)
    Test with chrome color contrast

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Homepage
  Quickly answer
  * What is this?
  * What do they have here?
  * What can I do here?
  * Why should I be here?
  * Where do I start?

  Search first and cathegory search
  Tagline (https://www.sketchapp.com/). Describe the product.
  Mottos explain bigger companies ethics. (www.ford.com). Not to use if new site.
  Use "welcome statement" to describe in more detail what the product is about. Place
  for example under tagline.

  Signup required? Then make it prominent on the page. Also explain why you should
  signup. For example to be part of conversation.

  Time sensitive information to let user know that site is active.
    The latest news
    Show date and timestamp
    Top story

  Discover new content
    Sign up for news letter.
    Clearly say what you get. "Top 5 stories a week"

  Steve Krug - the first few seconds spent on webpage are critical.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pricing pages
  Clearly state what included in price
  Offer recommendations can influence decision. (most popular options)
  Appeal to Intrinsic motivations (buy one and someone else how needs get one)
  Use testimonials (quotes from other users) to help during purchase. (reframe message)
  indiegogo.com
    Number of backers (SOCIAL PROOF)
    Time left (SCARCITY)

  Once user made choice, make it as easy as possible to follow through.
    Break into parts

  Trigger actions at right moment, when the user is motivated and able to take the action.

  Paradox of choice
    Too many options
    Users read 20% of words on a site.

  Use progressive disclosure
    Reduce page details, only show whats needed to make decision.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mobile
  Responsive to any device

  Mobile app should be consistent with app (user will know how to use the product)

  Even if the structure is different and looks difference between devices, the content
  should be continuous. That is, for example if article is read on mobile, it should
  be on read items on webapp.

  Design for the context, not the device!

  Who, What, When and Where = Context

  Only three icons are globally recognizable. House/Home, Magnifying glass/Search
  and printer/print.

  External triggers, used to engage users (facebook, twitter, etc). These
  exist in the "USERS ENVIRONMENT".

  Internal triggers, seeing an internal user/friend increases engagement.

  Triggers, achievements are great way to make user feel great.

  Good triggers prompt action!

  Notifications create intrigue
    It plays into our basic curiosity
    Ex. The most commented article

  Onboarding/Signup as easy as possible

  Short tutorial about the most important actions. More advanced features explained
  later when use is more familiar with the app. Use a big bold button to guide through.

  Once in the app, show user something to be able to follow. This helps to
  personalize the content to the users interest.

  Test everything on real users.
