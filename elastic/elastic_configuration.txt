Swapping
  1) disable it
    sudo swapoff -a
    or to disable it permanently edit /etc/fstab and comment
    out all swap lines.
  2) set the sysctl value vm.swappiness = 0. This will reduce
    the kernels swappiness.
  3) lock adress space
    in the config/elasticsearch.yml
      bootstrap.mlockall: true

  Check mlockall : curl http://localhost:9200/_nodes/process?pretty
  failed?
    Run as root : ulimit -l unlimited before starting elastic
  or

Upgrading
  1) Always snapshot

  During major elastic search upgrades a full cluster restart is required
